# Evolutionary Computing: Evolution Strategies

This is a step by step guide to Evolution Strategies applied to function
optimization. Several evolution schemes and strategies were implemented
over a set of classic test functions to check the performance of the method. 

## Getting Started

A C++11 implementation of an optimizer using Evolution Strategies 

### Prerequisites
